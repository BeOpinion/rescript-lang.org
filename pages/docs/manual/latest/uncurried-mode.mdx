# Uncurried Mode

Since ReScript 11, the language compiles in "uncurried" mode by default.
Before that, currying in ReScript looked like this:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = add(5)
```

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b | 0;
}

function addFive(param) {
  return 5 + param | 0;
}
```

</CodeTab>

It is shorter than having to write all remaining parameters again.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = (b) => add(5, b)
```

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b | 0;
}

function addFive(b) {
  return 5 + b | 0;
}
```

</CodeTab>

In ReScript 11, that would yield an error.

```rescript
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = add(5) // <-- Error:
// This uncurried function has type (. int, int) => int
// It is applied with 1 arguments but it requires 2.
```

To fix it, you can just state the remaining parameters explicitly.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>
```res
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = (b) => add(5, b)
```

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b | 0;
}

function addFive(b) {
  return 5 + b | 0;
}
```
</CodeTab>

Or use the new explicit syntax for partial application.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>
```res
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = add(5, ...)
```

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b | 0;
}

function addFive(extra) {
  return 5 + extra | 0;
}
```
</CodeTab>

The former approach helps library authors support both ReScript 11 and earlier versions.

### No final unit necessary

In Uncurried Mode, the "final unit" pattern is not necessary anymore, while optional or default parameters are still supported.

```res
// old 
let myFun = (~name=?, ())

// new
let myFun = (~name=?)
```

### How to switch back to curried mode

While we strongly encourage all users to switch to the new uncurried mode, it is still possible to opt out. Just add a

```json
{
  "uncurried": false
}
```

to your `rescript.json`, and your project will be compiled in curried mode again.

If you have uncurried mode off and still want to try it on a per-file basis, you can turn it on via 

```rescript
@@uncurried
```

at the top of a `.res` file.
